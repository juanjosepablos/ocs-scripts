ocs-scripts
===========

Mainly Scripts to be used by ocs-inventory http://www.ocsinventory-ng.org/en/
Usually I add then on a zip with a executable  and they use a simple program.bat name so it can be used by the execute actioin on the build package.

They are mostly imported from  the unattended project. See the scripts https://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/unattended/wiki/Scripts
